				<p>In &sect;164.514(b), the Safe Harbor method for
					de-identification is defined as follows:</p>
				<p>(2)(i) The following identifiers of the individual or of
					relatives, employers, or household members of the individual, are
					removed:</p>
				<p>(A) Names</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(B) All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state,
					including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP code, and
					their equivalent geocodes, except for the initial three digits of
					the ZIP code if, according to the current publicly available data
					from the Bureau of the Census:</p>
				<p>(1) The geographic unit formed by combining all ZIP codes
					with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000
					people; and</p>
				<p>(2) The initial three digits of a ZIP code for all such
					geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to
					000</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(C) All elements of dates (except year) for dates that are
					directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission
					date, discharge date, death date, and all ages over 89 and all
					elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except
					that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single
					category of age 90 or older</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(D) Telephone numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(L) Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license
					plate numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(E) Fax numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(M) Device identifiers and serial numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(F) Email addresses</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(N) Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs)</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(G) Social security numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(O) Internet Protocol (IP) addresses</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(H) Medical record numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(P) Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(I) Health plan beneficiary numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(Q) Full-face photographs and any comparable images</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(J) Account numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(R) Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or
					code, except as permitted by paragraph (c) of this section; and</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(K) Certificate/license numbers</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>(ii) The covered entity does not have actual knowledge that
					the information could be used alone or in combination with other
					information to identify an individual who is a subject of the
					information.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>When can ZIP codes be included in de-identified information?</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Covered entities may include the first three digits of the
					ZIP code if, according to the current publicly available data from
					the Bureau of the Census: (1) The geographic unit formed by
					combining all ZIP codes with the same three initial digits contains
					more than 20,000 people; or (2) the initial three digits of a ZIP
					code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer
					people is changed to 000. This means that the initial three digits
					of ZIP codes may be included in de-identified information except
					when the ZIP codes contain the initial three digits listed in the
					Table below.&nbsp; In those cases, the first three digits must be
					listed as 000.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>OCR published a final rule on August 14, 2002, that modified
					certain standards in the Privacy Rule.&nbsp; The preamble to this
					final rule identified the initial three digits of ZIP codes, or ZIP
					code tabulation areas (ZCTAs), that must change to 000 for release.
					67 FR 53182, 53233-53234 (Aug. 14, 2002)).</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Utilizing 2000 Census data, the following three-digit ZCTAs
					have a population of 20,000 or fewer persons. To produce a
					de-identified data set utilizing the safe harbor method, all
					records with three-digit ZIP codes corresponding to these
					three-digit ZCTAs must have the ZIP code changed to 000. Covered
					entities should not, however, rely upon this listing or the one
					found in the August 14, 2002 regulation if more current data has
					been published.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The 17 restricted ZIP codes are:</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>036</p>
				<p>692</p>
				<p>878</p>
				<p>059</p>
				<p>790</p>
				<p>879</p>
				<p>063</p>
				<p>821</p>
				<p>884</p>
				<p>102</p>
				<p>823</p>
				<p>890</p>
				<p>203</p>
				<p>830</p>
				<p>893</p>
				<p>556</p>
				<p>831</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Department notes that these three-digit ZIP codes are
					based on the five-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Areas created by the
					Census Bureau for the 2000 Census. This new methodology also is
					briefly described below, as it will likely be of interest to all
					users of data tabulated by ZIP code. The Census Bureau will not be
					producing data files containing U.S. Postal Service ZIP codes
					either as part of the Census 2000 product series or as a post
					Census 2000 product. However, due to the public&rsquo;s interest in
					having statistics tabulated by ZIP code, the Census Bureau has
					created a new statistical area called the Zip Code Tabulation Area
					(ZCTA) for Census 2000. The ZCTAs were designed to overcome the
					operational difficulties of creating a well-defined ZIP code area
					by using Census blocks (and the addresses found in them) as the
					basis for the ZCTAs. In the past, there has been no correlation
					between ZIP codes and Census Bureau geography. Zip codes can cross
					State, place, county, census tract, block group, and census block
					boundaries. The geographic designations the Census Bureau uses to
					tabulate data are relatively stable over time. For instance, census
					tracts are only defined every ten years. In contrast, ZIP codes can
					change more frequently. Because of the ill-defined nature of ZIP
					code boundaries, the Census Bureau has no file (crosswalk) showing
					the relationship between US Census Bureau geography and U.S. Postal
					Service ZIP codes.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>ZCTAs are generalized area representations of U.S. Postal
					Service (USPS) ZIP code service areas. Simply put, each one is
					built by aggregating the Census 2000 blocks, whose addresses use a
					given ZIP code, into a ZCTA which gets that ZIP code assigned as
					its ZCTA code. They represent the majority USPS five-digit ZIP code
					found in a given area. For those areas where it is difficult to
					determine the prevailing five-digit ZIP code, the higher-level
					three-digit ZIP code is used for the ZCTA code. For further
					information, go to: https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>The Bureau of the Census provides information regarding
					population density in the United States.&nbsp; Covered entities are
					expected to rely on the most current publicly available Bureau of
					Census data regarding ZIP codes. This information can be downloaded
					from, or queried at, the American Fact Finder website
					(http://factfinder.census.gov).&nbsp; As of the publication of this
					guidance, the information can be extracted from the detailed tables
					of the &ldquo;Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF 1) 100-Percent
					Data&rdquo; files under the &ldquo;Decennial Census&rdquo; section
					of the website. The information is derived from the Decennial
					Census and was last updated in 2000.&nbsp; It is expected that the
					Census Bureau will make data available from the 2010 Decennial
					Census in the near future.&nbsp; This guidance will be updated when
					the Census makes new information available.</p>
